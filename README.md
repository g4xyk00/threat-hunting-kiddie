##  Log Analysis
Apache
```bash
cat access.log | grep "<apache_keyword>"
tail -n 1 access.log 
less access.log
```
## Webshell
PHP
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.php" | xargs egrep -i "(fsockopen|pfsockopen|exec|shell|eval|rot13|base64|passthru|system)"
```
## File System Integrity
Apache
```bash
for f in $(ls); do echo $(md5sum $f); done > baseline.txt
diff baseline.txt compare.txt
```
## Web Directory Integrity
Apache
```bash
cd /var/www/html && find . -mtime -1
```
